# Module-6 Challenge
## Over all objective of this excercise
I used use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, it  chooses four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
